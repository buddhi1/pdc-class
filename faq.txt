1) How to copy files/data from my local pc to a node in the cluster?

	a) Using clipboard.
		You can use copy paste file contents just as you do in the local pc. But this is only suitable for small files and when there are only a few. 
	b) Using scp or sftp.
		Use scp command or a sftp session to copy your files from local machine to cluster.
	c) Using git. 
		Create a git repo in your local pc and push the files and data to remote. You can clone that repo and pull updates in the cluster.

	d) Using Globus (https://www.globus.org/).
		Globus is a great tool to trasnfer especailly data among clusters and your local pc. However this service might not be avalibale on all clusters (Indiana Jetstream2 has support).
